# WP OO Plugin Framework

This was an learning Project, which I never completed.

## Intro: Why it stopped

The intention of this project was to build a framework, that allows to create object orientated plugins for Wordpress, but I ended here because it has become way to complex, overhat creationed and harmed too many principles of "Clean Code, Clean Architecture, Layered Architecture ... ".
